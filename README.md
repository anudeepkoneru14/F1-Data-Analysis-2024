# F1 Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves detailed analysis of F1 data from the 2024 Monaco, Canada, and Spanish Grand Prix events. The focus is on various performance aspects of the drivers and teams to gain deeper insights into their race strategies and setups.

## Contents

1. **Monaco 2024 - Pace Comparison**
    - **Objective:** Compare the qualifying pace of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell.
    - **Details:** Analyzes specific track segments where Hamilton lost time compared to Russell by examining lap times, speed data, and sector splits.

2. **Canada 2024 - Ideal Lap Analysis and Long Run Pace**
    - **Ideal Lap Analysis:** Constructs the ideal lap using the best sector times from each driver to assess potential performance.
    - **Long Run Pace Analysis:** Evaluates the consistency and tire degradation over extended runs in Friday practice sessions to understand race strategies.
    - **Top Speeds Analysis:** Compares top speeds of each constructor to analyze the drag vs downforce trade-off and their aerodynamic efficiencies.
    - **Saturday Qualifying Analysis:** Examines driver performances and strategies during Saturday qualifying sessions.

3. **Spanish GP - Practice and Qualifying Analysis**
    - **FP1 Long Run Pace Analysis:** Evaluated the performance consistency and tire degradation over extended runs in FP1 to understand race strategies.
    - **FP2 Qualifying Pace Analysis:** Analyzed the drivers' one-lap performance during FP2 to gauge their qualifying potential.
    - **FP2 Long Run Analysis:** Further assessed long run pace during FP2 for a comprehensive understanding of race preparations.
    - **Top Speeds in FP1 and FP2:** Compared top speeds in both practice sessions to evaluate aerodynamic performance and efficiency.
    - **Qualifying Top Speed Analysis:** Examined top speeds during qualifying to understand the balance between drag reduction and downforce optimization.
